#### Can I write an article?
Yep! Read the long description in the [article submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzw5uXqcdP-mh42WVbWXpmQrXJi15lYG8HrIvIJBf7cTofkA/viewform), and put your article in it. If you want to regularly contribute articles, join [the Discord](https://linktr.ee/liputenpo) and ask about it.

#### Do I have to pay?
lipu tenpo is a non-profit magazine run entirely on volunteers. We do have [a Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/liputenpo/) where you can support us and even order physical copies!

#### Can I join the team?
If you are fluent in toki pona and can (and want to) regularly write articles, proofread others' articles or help with the layout or social media you are very welcome! The same goes for helping with our illustration, for which you don't have to be fluent :)

#### What's your copyright policy like? Can I use one of the articles/images for myself?
Every article, image, etc given to lipu tenpo is published individually under CC-BY-SA 4.0. CC-BY-SA 4.0 means that you are allowed to do commercial things with it, have to give appropriate credit to the creator, and if you build-upon the work, the mentioned work has to be published under the same license.

#### This one issue doesn't have a sitelen pona version, why not?
Converting an issue to sitelen pona takes a significant amount of time; we simply cannot do it every issue. We've taken a few initiatives to fix this, mostly by asking a few other people to take on the role, but haven't had a successful attempt of that quite yet. If you're willing to put in a few hours for every release, are willing to do this for every release, come and join our team :). Please read more [here](https://github.com/lipu-tenpo/selo/issues/2)

#### Can I put up an ad of some sort?
Absolutely! Write a discord DM or mail to the editors. These are free of charge, but it is up to us whether an ad would fit into a lipu tenpo!

#### Can I get some spare issues for my toki pona learning club/meetup?
Yes! Please email [lawapiliputenpo@gmail.com](mailto:lawapiliputenpo@gmail.com?cc=&bcc=&subject=o%20pana%20e%20lipu%20tawa%20mi!&body=%5Bhi%2C%20please%20send%20me%20some%20spare%20lipu%20tenpo%20issues%5D%0A(template%20follows)%0Awho%20are%20you%3F%0A%E2%80%A6%0Awhat%20is%20your%20event%2Fmeetup%2Fclub%3F%0A%E2%80%A6%0Ahow%20many%20people%20will%20attend%2Fdo%20attend%3F%0A%E2%80%A6%0Ais%20the%20event%2Fmeetup%2Fclub%20public%3F%20is%20there%20a%20link%20online%20or%20on%20https%3A%2F%2Fsona.pona.la%2Fwiki%2FGatherings%3F%0A%E2%80%A6%0Aby%20what%20date%20do%20you%20need%20the%20issues%20by%3F%0A%E2%80%A6%0A%5Bthanks%5D%0A) using [this template](/files/issues_email_template.txt). [Here](https://github.com/lipu-tenpo/print-and-post/blob/main/stock.txt) are the numbers of each issue we currently have spare. It will take some time to send them to you, try to account for this: 1 week for @alifeee to reply to you and sort out the postage; 2 weeks for post to arrive (international).
