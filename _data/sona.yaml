    answer: "There is the official book: Toki Pona: The Language of Good by Sonja Lang. It teaches how to use Toki Pona. Sonja made a Toki Pona Dictionary too. There are also several free online courses.

  - question: "This one issue doesn't have a sitelen pona version, why not?"
    answer: "Converting an issue to sitelen pona takes a significant amount of time; we simply cannot do it every issue.

If you're willing to put in a few hours for every release, are willing to do this for every release, come and join our team :). Please read more [here](https://github.com/lipu-tenpo/selo/issues/2)"
