  - question: "What is this?"
    answer: "Hello! You’re looking at the website for lipu tenpo, a magazine written in Toki Pona. Maybe you’re new and want to know more about this language. Great! This page hopes to answer some of your questions."
  - question: "What is Toki Pona?"
    answer: "Toki Pona is an elegant minimal language. It was created by the Canadian linguist Sonja Lang in 2001. It has only got 14 letters and about 130 words."
  - question: "Why would I learn Toki Pona?"
    answer: "Despite how tiny the language is, it is still possible to describe any concept with it. This might fascinate you. Maybe you just want to take a break from the complex world we live in. Or perhaps you just want to talk to your friends without others knowing what you’re saying."
  - question: "How can I learn Toki Pona, and where can I use it?"
    answer: "There is the official book: Toki Pona: The Language of Good by Sonja Lang. It teaches how to use Toki Pona. Sonja made a Toki Pona Dictionary too. There are also several free online courses. You can find Toki Pona groups and learning resources on [tokipona.org](https://tokipona.org/), the official website, as well as on our own website: [liputenpo.org](https://liputenpo.org)."

  - question: "This one issue doesn't have a sitelen pona version, why not?"
    answer: "Converting an issue to sitelen pona takes a significant amount of time; we simply cannot do it every issue. We've taken a few initiatives to fix this, mostly by asking a few other people to take on the role, but haven't had a successful attempt of that quite yet. If you're willing to put in a few hours for every release, are willing to do this for every release, come and join our team :). Please read more [here](https://github.com/lipu-tenpo/selo/issues/2)"
  - question: "Can I put up an ad of some sort?"
    answer: "Absolutely! Write a discord DM or mail to the editors. These are free of charge, but it is up to us whether an ad would fit into a lipu tenpo!"
