  - question: "This one issue doesn't have a sitelen pona version, why not?"
    answer: "Converting an issue to sitelen pona takes a significant amount of time; we simply cannot do it every issue. We've taken a few initiatives to fix this, mostly by asking a few other people to take on the role, but haven't had a successful attempt of that quite yet. If you're willing to put in a few hours for every release, are willing to do this for every release, come and join our team :)"
  - question: "Can I put up an ad of some sort?"
    answer: "Absolutely! Write a discord DM or mail to the editors. These are free of charge, but it is up to us whether an ad would fit into a lipu tenpo!"
